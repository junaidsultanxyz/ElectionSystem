## Overview

**Pakistan Election System** is a Java Swing-based desktop application developed using **FlatLaf** for modern UI styling.  
This system is designed to simulate the core functionality of an election management system in Pakistan.

It follows a **three-tier architecture**:
- **Client** â€“ Provides the user interface and interacts with the server.
- **Server** â€“ Processes requests, applies business logic, and communicates with the database.
- **Database** â€“ Stores all persistent data related to voters, candidates, results, and more.

## Tech Stack

- **Java (Swing + FlatLaf)** â€“ GUI
- **Socket Programming** â€“ Client-server communication
- **MySQL** â€“ Relational database
- **Maven** â€“ Dependency management
- **XAMPP** â€“ Localhost database server

## System Architecture

```
Client GUI â‡„ Server (Socket I/O) â‡„ MySQL Database
```

- **Client** sends request (e.g., vote, register).
- **Server** validates and processes the request.
- **Server** performs database operations and sends response back.
- **Client** displays the result or updates the UI accordingly.
